## Immune repertoire diversity
<hr>

Genetic recombination and clonal selection generates and maintains the breadth and specificity of $\sim 10^{12}$ T and B lymphocytes in human body.

--

- T cells: Diversity estimates $10^{15}$ - $10^{61}$ of different combinations of TCR $\alpha\beta$ chains.

- B cells: Theoretical diversity  $>10^{14}$, which is further augmented by somatic hypermutation (SHM) during immune responses.

We measure this  out of sample prediction error using Leave-One-Out cross validation, in which a single observation is treated as test dataset and rest of the observations are treated as training data. The process is repeated for all 'n' observations and the prediction error for each left-out test set is aggregated to calculate Leave-One-Out information criterion (LOOIC).



$$
\small \Delta \text{LooIC} = \text{LooIC}_i - \text{min}(\text{LooIC})
$$

  - $\small \Delta \text{LooIC} = 0 \Rightarrow$ Best-fit model. 
  - Higher values suggest poorer support from the data.

???
Only relative values of LooIC are meaningful

$$
]

- Proportional statistical support among the models under consideration.

???
We then used the estimated LOO-IC values to assess the relative support for models using the analog of the Akaike weight which gives us the probability that a given model will explain new data better than other models considered in this analysis.

inter div time for both donor and host is SAME! booth rarley divide most of the ki67 is inherited.

This naturally explains there host; donor diffs in Ki67 - NOT ANY INTRINSIC HOST/DONOR DIFFS - RATHER,  soon after BMT the donor cells in the FM pool have all recently entered from the T1 pool, who are rapidly dividing -  so will be transiently enriched for cell that inhertityed ki67. But over time as the population turns over, host and donor look same. And there is actually very  little division within FM cells.
